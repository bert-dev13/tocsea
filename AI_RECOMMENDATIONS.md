# How the AI Makes Reliable Recommendations

Simple explanation of how the AI ensures its plant recommendations are suitable and accurate.

## How the AI Chooses Plants

The AI checks three things before recommending any plant:

### 1. Soil Type Match

The AI matches plants to your soil type:

- **Sandy Soil** (drains quickly) → Coconut, Casuarina, Vetiver grass
- **Clay Soil** (holds water) → Mahogany, Bamboo, Pandan
- **Loamy Soil** (balanced) → Almost any plant works well
- **Silty Soil** (holds moisture) → Mahogany, Bamboo, Pandan, Vetiver
- **Peaty Soil** (acidic, organic-rich) → Acid-loving plants, Pandan
- **Chalky Soil** (alkaline) → Casuarina, alkaline-tolerant plants

### 2. Erosion Control Ability

The AI recommends plants that prevent erosion:
- **Deep-rooted trees** (Mahogany, Coconut) → Hold soil together
- **Grasses** (Vetiver) → Cover large areas quickly
- **Bamboo** → Creates barriers against water

### 3. Local Climate

The AI recommends plants that:
- Grow well in tropical climates
- Can handle typhoons and floods
- Are native or adapted to local conditions

## How the AI Decides Quantities

Simple rule: **More Soil Loss = More Plants Needed**

- **Low (0-10,000 square meters)** → 10-20 trees, 30-50 grass clumps
- **Medium (10,000-50,000 square meters)** → 20-40 trees, 50-100 grass clumps
- **High (50,000+ square meters)** → 40-60+ trees, 100+ grass clumps

**Example:**
- Soil Loss: 85,500 square meters (HIGH)
- Soil Type: Loamy
- **Recommendation:** Coconut (35 trees), Mahogany (30 trees), Vetiver (100 clumps), Bamboo (40 clusters)

## The Rules the AI Follows

Before recommending, the AI checks:

1. ✅ Does this plant grow well in this soil type?
2. ✅ Is the number of plants enough for this erosion level?
3. ✅ Has this plant been used successfully for erosion control?
4. ✅ Will this plant survive typhoons and floods?
5. ✅ Am I recommending different types of plants? (variety is good)
6. ✅ Are the numbers realistic? (not too many, not too few)

Only if all checks pass, the AI recommends it.

## Why You Can Trust the AI

### 1. Expert Knowledge
The AI has learned from:
- Scientific research papers
- Agricultural studies
- Real-world projects
- Expert knowledge

### 2. Proven Methods
The AI doesn't guess. It uses:
- What has worked before
- Scientific principles
- Best practices from experts

### 3. Personalized Recommendations
The AI looks at:
- Your exact soil type
- Your exact erosion level
- Your local conditions

Then gives recommendations that fit YOUR situation.

### 4. Multiple Checks
Before recommending, the AI verifies:
- ✅ Will this plant grow here?
- ✅ Will this help with erosion?
- ✅ Is this the right amount?
- ✅ Is this realistic?

## Important Note

The AI's recommendations are based on scientific knowledge and proven methods, but you should also:
- ✅ Consider local conditions
- ✅ Talk to local experts
- ✅ Test on a small area first

The AI gives you a great starting point, but real-world testing is always important!

## Simple Summary

**How the AI chooses plants:**
- Checks if plant grows in your soil type
- Checks if plant helps prevent erosion
- Checks if plant handles local weather

**How the AI decides quantities:**
- More soil loss = more plants needed
- Uses proven formulas to calculate

**Why it's reliable:**
- Uses expert knowledge
- Follows proven rules
- Checks multiple things
- Considers your specific situation
